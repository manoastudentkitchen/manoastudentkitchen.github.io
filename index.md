# About Manoa Student Kitchen

Manoa Student Kitchen will be an application that provides students at UH Manoa to share and browse any recipe that:

* Can be made using minimal kitchen facilities (at a minimum, a toaster oven).
* Can be made out of ingredients that are available within walking distance of UH.
* Suits local taste sensibilities.

It also will include information about the recipes

* Filters by dietary restriction (gluten-free, vegan, etc).
* Estimated cost per serving.
* Estimated number of servings per recipe.
* Estimate of how long it takes to make.
* Where each ingredient can be purchased
* Dynamic, user-based tags for each recipe

Manoa Student Kitchen is based on the project [Toaster Oven Lovin](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s17/morea/final-project/reading-project-toaster-oven-lovin.html)

# Development History

The development process for BowFolios conformed to Issue Driven Project Management practices. In a nutshell, development consists of a sequence of Milestones. Milestones consist of issues corresponding to 2-3 day tasks. GitHub projects are used to manage the processing of tasks during a milestone.

The following sections document the development history of Manoa Student Kitchen.

## Milestone 1: Mockup development

This milestone was started on April 5, 2017 and ended on April 13, 2017.

The goal of Milestone 1 was to create a set of HTML pages providing a mockup of the pages in the system. To simplify things, the mockup was developed as a Meteor app. This meant that each page was a template and that FlowRouter was used to implement routing to the pages.
