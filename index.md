# About Manoa Student Kitchen

Manoa Student Kitchen will be an application that provides students at UH Manoa to share and browse any recipe that:

* Can be made using minimal kitchen facilities (at a minimum, a toaster oven).
* Can be made out of ingredients that are available within walking distance of UH.
* Suits local taste sensibilities.

It also will include features such as:

* Filters by dietary restriction (gluten-free, vegan, etc).
* Estimated cost per serving.
* Estimated number of servings per recipe.
* Estimate of how long it takes to make.

...

Manoa Student Kitchen is based on the project [Toaster Oven Lovin](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314s17/morea/final-project/reading-project-toaster-oven-lovin.html)
